# Romeo and Juliet ODE TCP/IP Client-Server Architecture

This project implements a client-server architecture for solving the Romeo and Juliet ordinary differential equation (ODE) over a ```TCP/IP``` network. The scenario is inspired by ```William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet```, where the playwriter acts as a matchmaker between the two lovers and exchanges love letters while writing the play. Each verse of the play corresponds to different values of the ODE over time. At the end of the iterations, the novel containing the annotated ODE values is dumped into a ```.csv``` file. 

- The client and servers communicate using a TCP/IP protocol. The client sends requests to the servers, and the servers respond with the calculated values of the ODE. The client then annotates these values in the novel.

# Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

- Client (Playwriter): The client application responsible for initiating communication with the servers, requesting ODE values, and annotating them in the novel.

- Server 1 (Romeo): The server application that solves one of the equations of the Romeo and Juliet ODE.

- Server 2 (Juliet): The server application that solves the other equation of the Romeo and Juliet ODE.


# Getting Started

To get started with the ODE-Verse-Matchmaker, ensure that you have [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [JavaFX SDK](https://openjfx.io/) installed. Follow the steps below:
